# My first React calculator App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I used the calculator in Tyler Potts nice YouTube video [Build a CALCULATOR APP in REACT JS _ A React JS Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX-6Y2oGjI) as a starting point. But I did it my own way and added some further functional refinements.
